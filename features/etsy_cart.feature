  In order to show the basic cart functionality
  As a user
  I want to add and remove items from the cart

  Scenario: Item can be removed from cart

    Given the cart contains one item
    When the item is removed
    Then the cart will be empty

    Given that the cart is empty
    When an item is added to the cart
    Then the cart contains that item
